## Abstract

This repository implements a quantum error correction (QEC) code switcher between Surface-13 and Surface-17 codes using PennyLane. The code switcher enables the conversion of quantum states encoded in one error correction code to another while preserving the logical information. This capability is crucial for modular quantum computing architectures where different physical components may employ different error correction strategies. Our implementation demonstrates bidirectional conversion between Surface-13 (a [[9,1,3]] code with 4 stabilizers) and Surface-17 (a [[9,1,3]] code with 8 stabilizers), with comprehensive testing for various error models and logical states.

> **Note:** This repository is intended as an example or "hello world" demonstration of quantum code switching between two surface codes. It is not a general-purpose library for the broader goal of a flexible, provider-agnostic quantum error correction code switching toolkit. If there is enough interest from the community, I would love to contribute to and manage such a comprehensive library in the future.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Quantum Error Correction

Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for practical quantum computing, as quantum systems are inherently susceptible to noise and decoherence. Unlike classical error correction, which can directly measure and copy bits, quantum error correction must overcome the no-cloning theorem and the measurement problem. QEC codes work by encoding logical qubits into multiple physical qubits, creating a code space where errors can be detected and corrected without directly measuring the encoded quantum information.

Surface codes are a family of topological quantum error correction codes that arrange qubits on a two-dimensional lattice. They are particularly promising for practical quantum computing due to their high error thresholds and local check operators (stabilizers). The stabilizer formalism provides a powerful framework for describing these codes, where the code space is defined as the simultaneous +1 eigenspace of a set of commuting Pauli operators.

### 1.2 Surface Codes: Surface-13 and Surface-17

This repository focuses on two specific surface codes:

**Surface-13 Code**: A [[9,1,3]] code that uses 9 data qubits and 4 ancilla qubits. It has 4 stabilizers (2 X-type and 2 Z-type) and a code distance of 3, meaning it can correct any single-qubit error.

**Surface-17 Code**: A [[9,1,3]] code that uses 9 data qubits and 8 ancilla qubits. It has 8 stabilizers (4 X-type and 4 Z-type) and also has a code distance of 3. The increased number of stabilizers provides more syndrome information, potentially improving error detection capabilities.

Both codes encode a single logical qubit (k=1) using 9 physical data qubits (n=9) and have a code distance of 3 (d=3).

### 1.3 Logical Operations in Surface Codes

A critical aspect of quantum error correction codes is the set of logical operations they support. Different codes often have different sets of transversal (fault-tolerant) gates, which are operations that can be applied reliably without spreading errors.

#### Surface-13 Logical Operations

The Surface-13 code supports the following logical operations:

1. **Logical X**: Implemented by applying X gates to qubits 0, 1, and 2.
2. **Logical Z**: Implemented by applying Z gates to qubits 0, 3, and 6.
3. **Logical H**: Not transversal, requires code switching or magic state distillation.
4. **Logical T**: Not transversal, requires code switching or magic state distillation.
5. **Logical CNOT**: Can be implemented using lattice surgery between two Surface-13 codes.

#### Surface-17 Logical Operations

The Surface-17 code supports the following logical operations:

1. **Logical X**: Implemented by applying X gates to qubits 2, 4, and 6.
2. **Logical Z**: Implemented by applying Z gates to qubits 0, 4, and 8.
3. **Logical H**: Not transversal, requires code switching or magic state distillation.
4. **Logical S**: Transversal, can be implemented directly.
5. **Logical T**: Not transversal, requires code switching or magic state distillation.
6. **Logical CNOT**: Can be implemented using lattice surgery between two Surface-17 codes.

The difference in available transversal gates between these codes is a key motivation for code switching. For example, if a quantum algorithm requires a sequence of S gates followed by X gates, it may be more efficient to execute the S gates in the Surface-17 code (where S is transversal) and then switch to the Surface-13 code for the X gates.

## 2. Code Switching in Quantum Error Correction

### 2.1 Why Code Switching is Required

Code switching between different quantum error correction codes is necessary for several important reasons:

1. **Modular Quantum Computing**: Different physical implementations of quantum processors may use different error correction strategies. Code switching enables seamless communication between these modules.

2. **Resource Optimization**: Different codes have different resource requirements and error-correction capabilities. Code switching allows for dynamic adaptation to changing computational needs.

3. **Fault-Tolerant Computation**: Some quantum operations may be easier to implement in certain codes. Switching between codes can facilitate more efficient implementation of fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.

4. **Complementary Logical Gate Sets**: Different codes often support different sets of transversal (fault-tolerant) logical gates. Code switching allows a quantum computer to leverage the strengths of multiple codes, executing each operation in the code where it is most efficiently implemented.

5. **Error Adaptation**: Different error models may be better handled by different codes. Code switching enables adaptation to varying noise environments.

6. **Quantum Communication**: When transmitting quantum information between different quantum devices, code switching may be necessary to interface between different error correction strategies.

### 2.2 Challenges in Code Switching

Code switching presents several technical challenges:

1. **Preserving Quantum Information**: The logical information must be preserved during the conversion process.

2. **Error Propagation**: Errors present in the source code may propagate or transform during the switching process.

3. **Resource Overhead**: The switching process itself requires additional quantum operations, which may introduce new errors.

4. **Code Compatibility**: The source and target codes must be compatible in terms of their logical operations and error correction capabilities.

5. **Fault Tolerance**: The switching protocol itself must be fault-tolerant to prevent catastrophic error propagation.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Architecture Overview

Our implementation uses PennyLane, a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine learning, differentiable programming, and optimization. The code switcher consists of three main components:

1. **Surface-13 Code Implementation**: Defines the Surface-13 code structure, stabilizers, and logical operators.

2. **Surface-17 Code Implementation**: Defines the Surface-17 code structure, stabilizers, and logical operators.

3. **Code Switcher**: Implements the conversion between the two codes.

### 3.2 Code Switcher Implementation

The `code_switcher.py` file serves as the central component of our implementation, providing a command-line interface for running and converting between quantum error correction codes. Here's a detailed breakdown of its structure and functionality:

#### 3.2.1 Core Components

- **Imports and Dependencies**: The code relies on PennyLane for quantum circuit simulation, along with the surface code implementations from `surface_13_code.py` and `surface_17_code.py`.

- **Code Conversion Circuit**: The `code_conversion_circuit` function implements the quantum circuit for converting between Surface-13 and Surface-17 codes.

- **Command-Line Interface**: The `main` function parses command-line arguments and executes the appropriate code based on user input.

#### 3.2.2 Code Conversion Circuit

The code conversion circuit is the heart of the implementation, handling the complex task of transferring quantum information between different error correction codes:

```python
def code_conversion_circuit(source_code="surface13", target_code="surface17", initial=0, error_type=None, error_qubit=None):
    """
    Quantum circuit that converts between Surface-13 and Surface-17 codes.
    """
    # Define quantum device
    max_qubits = max(S13_QUBITS, S17_QUBITS)
    dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=max_qubits)
    
    @qml.qnode(dev)
    def conversion_circuit():
        # 1. Encode in source code
        if source_code == "surface13":
            # Prepare logical state in Surface-13
            # Apply stabilizers
            # Apply errors if specified
            
            # 2. Decode from Surface-13
            # Extract logical information
            
            # 3. Encode into Surface-17
            # Reset ancilla qubits
            # Apply stabilizers
            
        else:  # source_code == "surface17"
            # Similar process for Surface-17 to Surface-13
            
        # 4. Measure in target code basis
        # Return syndrome measurements and logical operator
        
    return conversion_circuit()
```

The circuit performs these key steps:

1. **Source Code Encoding**: Prepares the logical state in the source code and applies any specified errors.
2. **Decoding**: Extracts the logical information from the source code.
3. **Target Code Encoding**: Re-encodes the logical information into the target code.
4. **Measurement**: Measures the stabilizers and logical operators in the target code basis.

#### 3.2.3 Command-Line Interface

The code switcher provides a flexible command-line interface:

```python
def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description="Quantum error-correcting code switcher"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--code", choices=["surface13", "surface17"], required=True,
        help="Select which surface code to run"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--initial", type=int, default=0,
        help="Initial logical state (0 or 1) for surface17"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--error_type", choices=["X", "Y", "Z"], default=None,
        help="Type of single-qubit error to apply"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--error_qubit", type=int, default=None,
        help="Index of qubit to apply error"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--convert_to", choices=["surface13", "surface17"], default=None,
        help="Convert to this code (if specified)"
    )
    # Parse arguments and execute appropriate code
```

This interface allows users to:
- Select which surface code to run (`--code`)
- Specify the initial logical state (`--initial`)
- Apply specific error types to specific qubits (`--error_type` and `--error_qubit`)
- Convert between codes (`--convert_to`)

### 3.3 Code Switching Protocol

The code switching protocol follows these steps:

1. **Encode in Source Code**: Prepare the logical state in the source code (Surface-13 or Surface-17).

2. **Apply Errors (Optional)**: Apply X, Z, or Y errors to specific qubits if specified.

3. **Decode from Source Code**: Extract the logical information from the source code.

4. **Encode into Target Code**: Re-encode the logical information into the target code.

2. **Error Handling**: The code switcher correctly handles X, Z, and Y errors on various qubits, including corner and center qubits.

3. **Logical State Preservation**: The code switcher preserves the logical state (|0⟩ or |1⟩) during the conversion process.

4. **Syndrome Patterns**: The syndrome patterns observed in the Surface-17 code provide more detailed error information compared to the Surface-13 code, due to the larger number of stabilizers.

5. **Error Propagation**: Some errors in the source code lead to different syndrome patterns in the target code, indicating a transformation of the error during the switching process.

## 5. Discussion and Future Work

### 5.1 Limitations

The current implementation has several limitations:

1. **Idealized Simulation**: The code runs on an idealized quantum simulator without realistic noise models.

2. **Limited Code Distance**: Both codes have a distance of 3, limiting their error correction capabilities to single-qubit errors.

3. **Simplified Decoding**: The decoding process is simplified and does not implement full syndrome-based error correction.

### 5.2 Future Directions

Several directions for future work include:

1. **Realistic Noise Models**: Incorporate realistic noise models to evaluate the performance of the code switcher under practical conditions.

2. **Higher-Distance Codes**: Extend the implementation to higher-distance surface codes for improved error correction capabilities.

3. **Optimized Switching Protocols**: Develop optimized protocols for code switching that minimize resource overhead and error propagation.

4. **Hardware Implementation**: Adapt the code for specific quantum hardware platforms.

5. **Additional Code Families**: Extend the code switcher to support other QEC code families, such as color codes or quantum LDPC codes.

The code switcher enables bidirectional conversion of quantum states while preserving logical information and handling various error types. This capability is crucial for modular quantum computing architectures and provides a foundation for further research in quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computing.
